// pyroclient: PyroWave decode on the headset, delivered as RGBA8 AHardwareBuffers.
//
// The ALVR client is GLES/EGL and imports a frame the same way it imports MediaCodec's output:
// an AHardwareBuffer wrapped in an EGLImage. This library gives it exactly that for PyroWave.
// It owns a Vulkan device, lends it to PyroWave (the borrowed-device path: nothing is imported or
// exported between us and the codec), decodes into three plain R8 planes, and converts them into
// one of a ring of RGBA8 AHardwareBuffer-backed images. Every call is synchronous: when
// pyroclient_decode returns, the buffer is finished on the GPU and safe to import.
//
// Everything here was proven first in tools/pyrowave_android (55 dB against the PC reference);
// the three silent failure modes recorded there are handled: our own command buffer and submit,
// the queue type matching the decode path, and explicit layout transitions.
