# Quest3-Pyrowave

**PCVR streaming for Meta Quest 3, with PyroWave wavelet decoding directly on the Adreno GPU.**

An experimental ALVR fork for high-quality, low-latency streaming over USB and fast local networks.
Vulkan handles wavelet decoding; ALVR supplies SteamVR integration, tracking, controllers and audio.

## 📍 Current status

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Latest release** | **alpha.9 / `.63`**: a decoder about twice as fast, any refresh rate from 144 to 240 Hz with PC-driven panel switching over USB, Decoder V2 for smoother CDF 5/3 images, bitrate up to 4000 Mbps, two parallel wired video connections, and measured Wi-Fi streaming with connection fixes. [Release notes →](docs/RELEASE-alpha.9.md) |
| **On main since alpha.9** | **`.64`** (not yet released): safer parallel wired video. Frames are numbered, so a repeated timestamp can no longer mix two frames, and a stalled connection times out after 1 s and video falls back to the stream socket. Packed frames that no shader can convert are skipped instead of shown in wrong colours, and the dashboard's Auto text is corrected. Checked over Wi-Fi 6E (190.6 and 193.9 fresh FPS at 207 Hz, correct colours); the USB path it changes is not yet hardware-tested. [Handoff →](docs/HANDOFF.md) |
| **Best measured high-refresh setting** | **207 Hz · 2080 × 2208 per eye · Haar · 1000 Mbps · 4:2:0 · no foveation · maximum GPU clock over USB · direct eye copy**: 194–197 fresh FPS in 10–12 s screens with a 60°/s pan. [Frame trace →](docs/FRAME-TRACE.md) |
| **Over Wi-Fi** | The same 207 Hz stream at 1000 Mbps on Wi-Fi 6E (6 GHz, PC on Ethernet): 189–195 fresh FPS and about 6 ms of network time, about 3.4 ms more than USB. 1250 Mbps is the practical ceiling on the test link; 1500 queued frames hundreds of milliseconds late. [Wi-Fi →](docs/WIRELESS.md) |
| **Smoothest image** | CDF 5/3 (Decoder V2) removes Haar's block edges, for about 2 fresh FPS at 700 Mbps and more at higher bitrates. [Decoder V2 →](docs/DECODER-V2.md) |
| **What limits 207 Hz** | Frames that finish too close to the display deadline, the eye copy's fill cost (about 0.8 ms), and a headset memory clock the app cannot control. [Details →](docs/FRAME-TRACE.md#what-limits-207-hz-now) |
| **Fresh-install defaults** | A conservative 400 Mbps / 72 Hz candidate: Haar, 4:2:0, TCP, Quest 3 Auto → Compute. Pick a measured profile to go higher. |

## ✨ Why PyroWave?

| Capability | What it enables |
| --- | --- |
| 🎮 **Quest GPU decode** | Custom Vulkan wavelet reconstruction on Adreno: Haar in about 2.6 ms and CDF 5/3 in about 3–4 ms per 2080 × 2208 stereo frame at 690 MHz, written straight into the buffer the eye pass reads. |
| 🔌 **USB and Wi-Fi** | ALVR wired TCP forwarding or LAN streaming, both measured at 207 Hz. UDP is a separate experimental path. |
| ⚡ **High refresh** | Any whole rate from 144 to 240 Hz; over USB the PC switches the Quest 3 panel and restores it afterwards. |
| 📶 **Bitrate control** | A 5–4000 Mbps slider, a quality floor, measured profiles and latency-driven Auto bitrate. |
| 🖼️ **Independent render and encode sizes** | Render a sharper PC source while keeping the Quest's decoded pixel count fixed. |
| 🎨 **Chroma choices** | 4:2:0 by default; optional 4:4:4 for controlled quality comparisons. |
| 📊 **Performance overlay** | A client-rendered 3D panel: clicking both thumbsticks cycles Compact / Full / Hidden; a hold opens settings. |
| 🔬 **Reproducible research** | Pinned upstream sources, matching platform builds, regression checks and published measurements. |

PyroWave uses a custom wavelet codec and GPU reconstruction. H.264, HEVC and AV1 PCVR paths use
conventional codecs and the headset's hardware video decoder. High bitrate and full chroma are useful
research options, but spare bandwidth does not make PyroWave decoding free. This project has **not**
established a matched quality or latency advantage over those codecs or Virtual Desktop.

</details>

## 🚀 Quick start

### What you need

- **Meta Quest 3** with Developer Mode and USB debugging enabled for sideloading.
- **Windows PC** with SteamVR and a Vulkan GPU/driver that supports the required Vulkan–D3D11
  interop. SteamVR and the encoder must use the same GPU.
- **USB data cable**, preferably on a USB 3 port, or a fast LAN with the PC on Ethernet.

### Launch on PC and Quest

1. **Stop SteamVR** before changing server installations. Extract the Windows ZIP into a new
   folder so the previous installation stays available.
2. Run **`ALVR Dashboard.exe`** from the extracted folder. Register this server with its driver
   controls and enable the ALVR SteamVR add-on.
3. Install **`Quest3-Pyrowave-dev.apk`** with SideQuest or ADB. The app has its own package,
   `io.github.jms1717.quest3pyrowave`.
4. On the Quest, open **Quest3 PyroWave** from **Unknown Sources**. On the PC, explicitly trust the
   discovered headset in the dashboard, then start SteamVR.
5. In **Settings → Presets**, start with **Quest 3 PyroWave 400 Mbps / 72 Hz candidate**. Once that
   works over USB, choose a measured **Streaming profile**:

   | Profile | Per-eye stream | Best for |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | **Native 120 Hz** | 2064 × 2208 | The most frames per pixel |
   | **207 Hz** | 2080 × 2208 | Full resolution at high refresh |
   | **240 Hz scaled panel** | 1440 × 1536 | The highest refresh rate |

These are starting candidates, not guaranteed performance levels. The full
[installation and rollback guide](docs/BUILD.md#install-and-rollback) covers prerequisites,
controller emulation and restoring another driver.

### Choose your connection

| Connection | Setup | How to confirm it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🔌 **USB / TCP** | Plug in a data cable and enable **Devices → Wired Connection**. Use **PyroWave TCP** and the custom client package above. | The wired client is Streaming, the server peer is `127.0.0.1`, and ADB forwards include ports 9943/9944. [USB guide →](docs/USB.md) |
| 📡 **Wi-Fi / LAN** | PC on Ethernet, headset on a nearby 6 GHz (Wi-Fi 6E) access point. Trust the headset in **Devices**, or add its IP address. Use a constant **1000 Mbps** (1250 at most), or Auto with a maximum. | The client is Streaming from the headset's LAN address. Watch the overlay's network latency. [Wi-Fi measurements →](docs/WIRELESS.md) |

> [!NOTE]
> A connected cable alone does not prove the stream uses USB, and USB link speed or Wi-Fi PHY speed
> is not usable payload throughput. USB avoids the radio hop but still includes ADB forwarding, GPU
> decode and compositor work.

## 🔧 Settings and quality

| Setting | Where and what to start with |
| --- | --- |
| **Bitrate** | **Settings → Presets.** The slider sets a fixed payload cap; with Auto it sets a maximum. PyroWave keeps a quality floor of 0.25 bits per stream pixel (about 500 Mbps at 207 Hz with 2080 × 2208 per eye) and raises lower settings to it. [Details](docs/BITRATE.md) |
| **Auto bitrate** | Lowers the requested rate from network/encoder latency feedback. The quality floor raises its estimate, but the network-latency and maximum limits win, so on a congested link it goes lower instead of queuing frames. On Wi-Fi 6E it settled at about 550 Mbps with an 8 ms limit, which is conservative. It cannot guarantee FPS or remove a GPU bottleneck. |
| **Profiles** | **Settings → Presets → Streaming profile.** The three "(measured)" profiles set refresh, stream size, wavelet, chroma, bitrate and GPU clock together and keep the game's render resolution. [Measurements](docs/HIGH-REFRESH.md) |
| **Refresh** | 72–120 Hz, or any whole rate from 144 to 240 Hz with **Preferred FPS**. Over USB the PC switches the panel: 144–207 Hz natively, above 207 Hz in the scaled panel mode (1552 × 1664 per eye). [Capability detection](docs/REFRESH-RATES.md) |
| **Wavelet** | **Haar** (default) is fastest. **CDF 5/3** uses Decoder V2 and gives smoother gradients without Haar's 8-pixel block edges, for a few fresh FPS; pair it with the maximum GPU clock. [Decoder V2](docs/DECODER-V2.md) · [decoder findings](docs/DECODE-PIPELINE.md) |
| **GPU clock** | **Quest 3: maximum GPU clock** (690 MHz) helps whenever decoding limits the frame rate. The measured 207 and 240 Hz profiles turn it on. The PC applies it, and the panel switch, over USB adb only. [Details](docs/HIGH-REFRESH.md) |
| **Wired video connections** | Two by default over USB: each frame is split across parallel adb-forwarded connections, which shortens network time at 1000 Mbps and above. **0** restores the single stream socket. [Details](docs/BITRATE.md) |
| **Direct eye copy** | An opt-in developer property that draws decoded frames straight into the headset's eye images; the 207 Hz measurements on this page use it. With the headset on USB: `adb shell setprop debug.q3pw.direct_eye_copy 1`, then force-stop and reopen the app. Set it to `0` to return to ALVR's staging renderer, the default. [Frame trace](docs/FRAME-TRACE.md) |
| **Chroma** | Keep **4:2:0** for the baseline; 4:4:4 increased decode cost in the recorded comparison. [Chroma comparison](docs/CHROMA.md) |
| **Foveation** | Off by default. [Light peripheral encoding](docs/LIGHT-FOVEATION.md) is optional development work; sustained and in-headset acceptance are pending. |
| **Overlay** | On by default, in Compact mode. **Click both thumbsticks together** and release to cycle Compact → Full → Hidden. **Hold both** for about 0.7 s to open the headset settings menu. [Metrics and overrides](docs/OVERLAY.md) |
| **Controllers** | **Settings → Headset → Controllers → Emulation mode → Quest 3 Touch Plus.** SteamVR restarts to apply it. |

### Settings that restart SteamVR

Settings marked ⚠ (refresh, resolution, codec, wavelet, chroma, foveation, downsample filter,
controllers and the other SteamVR driver options) are read when a stream starts. If you change them
while streaming, they apply by themselves: 2 s after the last edit the headset reconnects, and SteamVR
restarts when the driver needs it. The stream returns about 25 s after the edit, so **save game
progress first**. Bitrate changes apply live without a reconnect. [Details](docs/SETTINGS-APPLY.md)

<details>
<summary><b>Bitrate budgets and experimental presets</b></summary>

<br>

The 600 / 800 / 1000 / 1500 / 2000 Mbps 120 Hz presets are experiments.

| Refresh | Payload ceiling per stereo frame at 1000 Mbps |
| --- | --- |
| 120 Hz | about **1.04 MB** |
| 207 Hz | about **0.60 MB** |

These are payload ceilings, not guaranteed utilization or quality. More bitrate improves quality but
costs decode time, most of all with CDF 5/3: at 207 Hz, 5/3 measured 185 fresh FPS at 700 Mbps, 179
at 1000 and 164 at 1500. [Profile math and measured bitrate comparisons](docs/BITRATE.md)

Refresh rates above 120 Hz are runtime-gated, and an accepted refresh does not imply an equal
fresh-frame rate. Rates above 120 Hz rely on the panel switch the PC applies over USB (or
`tools/quest3/refresh_scaling.py` by hand); do not assume every OS/runtime exposes the same modes.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Sharper PC source without a larger Quest decode</b></summary>

<br>

The two resolutions are independent:

| Per-eye size | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **SteamVR render recommendation** | Game source quality, subject to SteamVR percentages and game settings. |
| **PyroWave encoded resolution** | Stream dimensions and Quest decode workload. |

From the source checkout, with the matching server running:

```powershell
python -m tools.quest3.control resolution --profile supersampled3072
```

This requests **3072 × 3216** for the PC source while keeping encode/decode at **2080 × 2208 per
eye**. ALVR aligns the source recommendation to 3072 × 3232. Restart SteamVR afterwards; games may
need restarting too. Record the game's actual render size rather than assuming it equals the
recommendation.

Restore native geometry with `--profile native2080`. These controls keep bitrate, refresh, chroma
and decoder settings. Apply overall dashboard presets first, then independent geometry, since those
presets can set both sizes together.
[Resolution semantics and A/B procedure](docs/RENDER-ENCODE-RESOLUTION.md)

</details>

## 📊 Measured performance

Short live screens on Quest 3 over USB (Wi-Fi where noted), October 6–7, 2026. Unless noted, each
used 2080 × 2208 per eye encoded from a 3072 × 3216 render, 4:2:0, no foveation, the maximum GPU clock (690 MHz), the
direct eye copy (`debug.q3pw.direct_eye_copy=1`, see [Settings](#-settings-and-quality)), a 60°/s pan in ABBA order, and 10–12 s windows after a 3–5 s settle. Blocks whose headset memory clock
changed mid-window were rejected.

| Setting | Fresh FPS | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| **207 Hz · Haar · 1000 Mbps** | **194–197** | GPU decode p50 2.67 ms, eye copy 1.05–1.10 ms, frame age at display 30.4 ms p50. [Frame trace](docs/FRAME-TRACE.md) |
| 207 Hz · Haar · 1000 Mbps · **Wi-Fi 6E** | 189–195 | Network stage 6.1 ms p50 (USB: about 2.7). 1250 Mbps: 190–192 with worse tails; 1500 Mbps overloads the link. [Wi-Fi](docs/WIRELESS.md) |
| 207 Hz · CDF 5/3 · 700 Mbps | 185–193 | Two runs; about 2 FPS below Haar in the matched comparison. Visibly smoother gradients. [Decoder V2](docs/DECODER-V2.md) |
| 207 Hz · CDF 5/3 · 1000 / 1500 Mbps | 179 / 164 | Quality rises about 1.8 dB PSNR-HVS-M from 700 to 1000 Mbps. [Bitrate](docs/BITRATE.md) |
| 240 Hz scaled panel · 1440 × 1536 · Haar | 223–230 | October 6, before the faster decoder. [High refresh](docs/HIGH-REFRESH.md) |
| 120 Hz · 2064 × 2208 · Haar | about 119 | October 6, before the faster decoder. |
| 207 Hz · 4:4:4 | 68 | 4:2:0 stays the default. [Chroma](docs/CHROMA.md) |

**What the trace shows at 207 Hz.** Decode keeps up: 203 of 206 frames per second are decoded and
published. The rest are lost after publication. The render loop occasionally misses a display
period, about 5 % of display intervals receive two frames (so one is superseded), and a few receive
none. Opt-in experiments trade latency for a few frames. A release fence keeps every display period,
and a short frame hold shows both frames of a burst. Neither is a default.

> [!CAUTION]
> These are short screening measurements, not sustained gameplay or optical motion-to-photon tests.
> ALVR's estimated pipeline latency (about 30–33 ms at these settings) is not a measured
> motion-to-photon result. The headset's memory clock (2092 / 2736 / 3196 MHz) is not under app
> control and moves results by several FPS between sessions. See the
> [engineering handoff](docs/HANDOFF.md) and the [reviewed results](results/).

## 🧰 Troubleshooting

| Symptom | First action |
| --- | --- |
| **Dashboard will not open** | Launch it from the extracted server folder with its bundled files. Avoid mixing installations. |
| **Audio works, but video is black or corrupt** | Check APK/server provenance, the selected codec and foveation settings. Keep the logs and report the exact settings. |
| **Wi-Fi stream lags more and more** | The bitrate is above what the link delivers, and TCP queues the excess. Lower it to 1000 Mbps or use Auto with a maximum. [Wi-Fi](docs/WIRELESS.md) |
| **USB is plugged in, but video uses Wi-Fi** | Check the wired peer and ADB forwards with the [USB verification steps](docs/USB.md). |
| **Video stops after unplugging or replugging USB** | Replugging with two wired video connections has not been checked yet. Stop SteamVR, reconnect the cable and confirm `adb devices` lists the headset before restarting. If it recurs, set **Wired video connections** to **0** and [report it](https://github.com/JMS1717/Quest3-Pyrowave/issues). |
| **Game never appears in the headset** | Check SteamVR's active headset and the game's OpenXR runtime. [OpenXR setup and VD rollback](docs/OPENXR.md) |
| **FPS is below the selected refresh** | Use a measured profile over USB with the maximum GPU clock. Compare fresh-frame delivery, GPU decode and completion timing; more bitrate or CDF 5/3 costs decode time. |
| **Overlay will not hide** | A benchmark's forced-visible override can take precedence over the controller chord. [Clear the override](docs/OVERLAY.md) |
| **Wrong controller model** | Select Quest 3 Touch Plus. Older saved sessions or game-specific meshes can differ. |
| **APK update fails** | Compare signing certificates; PR builds can use different keys. Follow the [signing guide](docs/BUILD.md#android-apk). |

> [!TIP]
> **Returning to Virtual Desktop:** stop SteamVR, disable ALVR in SteamVR's **Manage Add-ons**, and
> leave Virtual Desktop's installation and registration as they are. If you changed the OpenXR
> runtime, follow the [runtime rollback guide](docs/OPENXR.md). Keep the previous matching APK/server
> pair when changing project installations.
